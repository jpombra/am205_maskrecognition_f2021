The following files relate to the following tasks:
1. svd.py contains and pre-processing of images and the singular value decomposition of those images to discern patterns and classify them
2. SVD_Speed_Comparison.ipynb compares the speed of a variety of different svd approaches over different dataset sizes. We specifically look at generic svd, divide and conquer svd, jit svd, and jit divide and conquer svd.
3. Neural_Network_Training_Analysis.ipynb generates convolutional neural networks for our three classification tasks, looks at evaluation, and also generates saliency maps
4. svd.ipynb uses svd to predict image classifications for our three tasks, evaluates for accuracy, precision, and recall, and also generates plots of first few left singular vectors as well as image projections. 

**Please let us know if you would like the image data - we assured confidentiality/not sharing the photos to many of our primary source subjects hence exclusion of the photos in this public github**
